How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

In order to interpret user needs and implement them into a program, one must begin by engaging with the end-users and the stakeholders to attempt to gain an understanding of their needs and their pain points.  Creating user stories can be very valuable here by creating a concise description of features as seen from the viewpoint of the end-user.  This is great because it becomes easier to understand due to its simplicity and its user-centric nature, and it also allows for the flexibility of adjusting priorities of user stories to focus on what is going to deliver the most value from the point of view of the end-user.




How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Approaching developing programs using agile processes involves the enablement of iterative development and adaptability, gained through rigorous and constant communication and feedback between the team and the end-users and stakeholders.  Breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable iterations have the potential to deliver value in a regular fashion without spending too much time between deliverables.  This allows for this continuous feedback from the stakeholders and end-users which in-turn allows for value-enhancing redirections to be undertaken by the team.  Implementing processes like scrum can be very helpful in this regard, as it emphasizes teamwork and accountability while defining roles, expectation and vision across the team(s) that can help to keep everyone on track.





What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

It means constant learning, asking questions and aligning of visions with other members of the team, allowing yourself to contribute effectively on a long timeline without having your skills become stale.  Providing constructuive feedback is paramount as it helps to work towards shared goals and solutions.  Collaborating with other members of the team towards the goal of providing real value is of the utmost importance here.
